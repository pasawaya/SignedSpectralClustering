# Signed Spectral Clustering

Implementation of the Signed Normalized Cuts algorithm described in [Gallier (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04692.pdf).

* `ssc.py` contains the signed normalized cuts implementation
* `affinities.py` generates an affinity matrix from a recipe dataset, clusters the ingredients, and performs various recipe rating prediction experiments using the clusters as features.

See `Report.pdf` for a thorough discussion of the implementation and application to recipe rating predictions.
